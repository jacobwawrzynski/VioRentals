* **Auth API** is responsible for a user authentication and authorization with JWT and a custom identity middleware

* **Web** contains a GUI for the application

## Microservices

### Description

Microservices are written in Rust and are responsible for the following tasks:

* **Lucky User Service** - returns a random user from the database (use random number service to get a random number and then get a user)

* **Recommended Movie Service** - returns a recommended movie from the database (use random number service to get a random number and then get a movie and send movie as "recommended")

### Endpoints

* **Random Number Service** - http://localhost:8000/random_number/from/to - where "from" and "to" are integers

* **Recommended Movie Service** - http://localhost:8001/recommend_movie

* **Lucky User Service** - http://localhost:8002/lucky_user
